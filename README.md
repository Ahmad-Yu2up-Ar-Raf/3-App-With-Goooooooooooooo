# My First Go Projects Collection 🚀

Welcome to my first collection of Go programming projects! This repository contains three basic yet fundamental projects that helped me learn Go programming concepts.

## 📑 Projects Overview

### 1. Custom Pyramid Generator 🔺
A fun console application that generates different types of pyramid patterns.

**Features:**
- Customizable pyramid symbol
- Adjustable pyramid size
- Three pattern options:
  - Full pyramid
  - Inverted pyramid
  - Both combined
- Animated drawing with 1-second delay between lines

### 2. Student Grade Management System 📚
A simple command-line student management system.

**Features:**
- Add students with their grades
- View complete student list
- Remove students by ID
- Clear all data
- Auto-incrementing ID system

### 3. Word Counter 📝
A character frequency analyzer for text input.

**Features:**
- Counts occurrence of each character in input text
- Displays character frequency
- Ignores whitespace
- Tracks character positions for repeated characters

## 🛠 How to Run

1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Uncomment the desired function in `main.go`:
```go
// 1. pyramid.Input()    // For pyramid generator
// 2. worldcount.World() // For word counter
// 3. List.List()        // For student grade management
```

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes
Through these projects, I learned:
- Basic Go syntax and structure
- Working with packages
- User input handling
- Control structures
- Data structures (maps, slices)
- Time operations
- String manipulation

## 🔜 Future Improvements
- Add input validation
- Implement error handling
- Add data persistence
- Create better UI/UX
- Add unit tests

This is my first step into Go programming. While these projects are basic, they helped me understand fundamental programming concepts in Go! 😊
